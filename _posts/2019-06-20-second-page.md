This project is called jekyll-latex. It allows you to write markdown posts using the Jekyll framework with the beautiful typography of <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> and the MathJax library so you can render gorgeous equations like this one below:
$$ J(\theta) =\frac{1}{2m}
[\sum^m_{i=1}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) -
y^{(i)})2 + \lambda\sum^n_{j=1}\theta^2_j $$
