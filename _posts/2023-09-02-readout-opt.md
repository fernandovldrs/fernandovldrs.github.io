The state of a superconducting qubit is measured with a probe microwave signal. By analyzing the probe after it has interacted with the system, 
we can extract its phase and amplitude values to assign the qubit state either to $\left|0\right>$ or $\left|1\right>$. 

Also called a readout signal, it is sent from
the room-temperature electronics and re-acquired after having interacted with the system. It carries information about the qubit
in its amplitude and phase (or, conversely, in its quadratures), and, therefore, we should learn how to extract the desired information
from these values.

The objective of this post is
