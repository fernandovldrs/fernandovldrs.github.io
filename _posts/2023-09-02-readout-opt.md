The state of a qubit is measured by analyzing a probe signal. Also called a readout signal, it is sent from
the room-temperature electronics and re-acquired after having interacted with the system. It carries information about the qubit
in its amplitude and phase (or, conversely, in its quadratures), and, therefore, we should learn how to extract the desired information
from these values.

The objective of this post is
