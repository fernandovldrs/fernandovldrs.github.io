"You want to study physics? You will be poor like me."

That's what my grandmother said to me during high-school when she noticed I liked studying physics after school hours. She had worked as a public school teacher in Brazil, and thought I would end up following such a difficult career if I majored in physics. But, even though I didn't really know what my job prospects would be (which 13 year-old does?), her blunt premonition didn't stop my aspirations to try and become a physics researcher. 

Graduate-level research not only makes you an expert in a specific field. It teaches you to be an independent problem-solver. This is a common mantra in grad students forums, especially on posts questioning the reasons for joining a research program. Someone must have told me something like this back then, because this idea stuck to me more than my grandmother's concerns. I continued studying and eventually enrolled to a PhD program because there is much more to graduate studies than just building a career. It was all about personal development.

I wanted to find and solve problems - real, difficult problems that only scientific research throws at you. I would only really understand what this really meant more than a decade later. At the age of 24, I moved to Singapore azs a PhD candidate in a superconducting quantum circuits laboratory. Quantum computers are infamous for being particularly delicate, relying on very precise and careful engineering to work. And my job was (and still is) to develop new circuits fore these computers, sometimes using my own hands to build prototypes. Every new idea that I had for my prototypes felt like defying reality - the most unforgiving of opponents.  If I wanted a challenge, I had found one for sure.

Because of such a high level of difficulty, learning problem-solving skills is a make-or-break condition in grad school. In the past three years doing research, I saw a significant change in the way I think, enablingh
