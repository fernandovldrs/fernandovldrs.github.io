"You want to study physics? You will be poo like me."

That's what my grandmother said to me during high-school when she noticed I liked studying physics even outside of the classroom. She had worked as a public school teacher in Brazil, and thought I would end up following such a difficult career if I majored in physics. But, even though I didn't really know what my job prospects would be (which 13 year-old does?), her blunt premonition didn't stop my aspirations to try and become a scientist. I continued studying and eventually enrolled to a PhD program because there is much more to graduate studies than just building a career. To me, it is all about personal development.

This is a common mantra in grad students forums, easy to find in wild posts questioning the purpose of joining a research program: "graduate-level research not only makes you an expert in a specific field. It teaches you to be an independent problem-solver".
