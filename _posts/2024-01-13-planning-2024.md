Last year ended on a high note with the conclusion of my last project, already [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14665.pdf). 

In a few words, my team and I achieved the integration of flux-tunable transmons to long-lived cavities. Once we are able to tune the transmon frequency within nanoseconds, 
we can control its interactions with the cavity on real time. This opens up a new world of operations in the field of bosonic CQED, in which the cavities are used as storages of information
and can benefit from this flexible control.

This project was exceedingly challenging due to the complicated hardware design and fabrication. But also because it was the first time I was put in a position of leading a research project. 
Looking back in time, I see how the results could have been sped up if I had more understanding of project management.

But I'm not a museum to dwell in the past. 2024 is just starting, and I can use these past learnings to plan my next research project. In fact, this sequel is already up and running - my 
colleagues are already working on some preliminary simulations to improve the previous hardware. So, now that I'm coming back from vacations, it is the right time to set
our research goals, rally the team and plan our tasks ahead of time. 

Inspired by this [this blog post](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/project-management-skills), I want to discuss a few management tasks that I believe will make our team more efficient.
The objective of this post is to reflect on my own experience and set attributions for myself for this year. If you are also a PhD student and also want to learn about management, I hope 
these reflections will be useful for us to learn it together.
