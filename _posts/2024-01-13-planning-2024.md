Last year ended on a high note with the conclusion of my last project, already [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14665.pdf). 

In a few words, my team and I achieved the integration of flux-tunable transmons to long-lived cavities. Once we are able to tune the transmon frequency within nanoseconds, 
we can control its interactions with the cavity on real time. This opens up a new world of operations for quantum systems that use cavities as storages of information, 
as done in the field of bosonic cQED.
