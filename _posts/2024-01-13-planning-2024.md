Last year ended on a high note with the conclusion of my last project, already [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14665.pdf). 

In a few words, my team and I achieved the integration of flux-tunable transmons to long-lived cavities. Once we are able to tune the transmon frequency within nanoseconds, 
we can control its interactions with the cavity on real time. This opens up a new world of operations in the field of bosonic CQED, in which the cavities are used as storages of information
and can benefit from this flexible control.

This project was exceedingly challenging due to the complicated hardware design and fabrication. But also because it was the first time I was put in a position of leading a research project. 
Looking back in time, I see how the results could have been improved of sped up if I had more understanding of project management.

But I'm not a museum to dwell in the past.
