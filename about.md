title: About
---

I'm an engineer and physicist working in quantum technologies. Born in Recife, Brazil, and currently based in Singapore. I am interested in superconducting circuits research, epistemology, educational content writing and science outreach. 

## Career

I graduated in electronics engineering in 2019 from the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I focused my studies on advanced electrodynamics, signal processing and quantum mechanics. In 2020, I obtained a MSc in Solid State Physics at the same institution. My dissertation on the theory of perovskite compounds for photovoltaics won the Prof. Cecchini award for best MSc research across all departments that year. I moved to Singapore in 2021 to join the recently opened qcrew laboratory, run by Prof. Yvonne Gao. Now I focus on learning the ins-and-outs of quantum hardware engineering with the intent of making it a life-long career.
